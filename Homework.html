        Yougurt is fairly easy to make at home and the result is much better in flavor and consistency than most commercial yougurt. You'll and also be able to choose what does or doesn't go into your yougurt (commercial brands often include 
        thickener and other non-dalry ingredients)
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>1 quart/ 1 litter milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yougurt (with actve cultures: all commercial brands will stare on the container if the yougurtt contains active culture)</li>

        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Step To Make It</strong></h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Gently heat the milk over medium low heat until it reaches 180oF/82oC. Turn off the heat and the milk cool down to between 106oF/41oC and 110oF/43oC.</li>
            <li>While the heated milk is cooling, wash the jars and leave them filled with hot water so the glass will be warm when you add the yogurt.</li>
            <li>When the milk has cooled enough, warm a large bowl or measuring cup by faling it with hot water Empty out the water. Straln rhe milk through a fine mesh strainer Into the warmed bowl. Whisk in the yogurt. Paur out the water in the 
                jars and pour in the milk plus yogurt mixture. Fasten the lids</li>
                <li>Place the jars in a warm but not hot place where they can remain undisturbed for B hours or overnight, An old fashioned oven in which the pilot light is always on is perfect. So is an oven with the light turned on but the heat 
                    off. Another option Is a fod dehydrator set to 110 F/43Â°C with the trays removed to make room for the Jars. Or you could buy a special yogurt maker that maintains the ideal temperature.</li>
                    <li>Be careful <I><srong>not</strong></I> to jostle the jars while the active yogurt cultures are working on the milk. Yogurt is very finicky about this, and will sometimes not set up well if the jars are moved during this period.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the jars to the refrigerator.</li>
        </ul>
